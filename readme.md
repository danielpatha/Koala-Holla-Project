# Koala Holla 

## Description

_Duration: 2 day Group Sprint_

This is a Prime Academy group project. Four fullstack engineering students created a web application for a fictitious client named Koala Holla (1976 Llama Comma Drive, Walla Walla WA) that transports koalas from the outdoors to other enviroments.

This web application is able to input new koalas into the existing database, mark koalas that are ready for transfer, and delete koalas from the database.

The group of students worked on pair coding and organizing of equal work. Students also worked together remotely to plan and review several pull requests. Lastly, the students focused on AJAX methodology using GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests to communicate between the server and client.
